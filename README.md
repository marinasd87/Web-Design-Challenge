# Web-Design-Challenge
For this challenge I've created a website that consist of 7 pages total, including:

- A landing page containing:
    
    + An explanation of the project.
    + Links to each visualizations page. Including a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image takes the user to that visualization.

- Four visualization pages, each with:

    + A descriptive title and heading tag.
    + The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
    + A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

- A "Comparisons" page that:

    + Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
    
- A "Data" page that:

    + Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
